K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

Objective: Implement and understand KNN for classification using Scikit-learn.

ðŸ”§ Tools

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib

ðŸ“˜ Steps

Load and normalize the dataset (Iris or custom CSV).

Split data into training and test sets.

Train KNN models for different values of K.

Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualize decision boundaries for two selected features.

ðŸ“Š Results

Compared train vs. test accuracy for different K values.

Identified best K based on accuracy.

Plotted decision regions and confusion matrix.
